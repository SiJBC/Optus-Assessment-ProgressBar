Simon Colman submission for Progress bar Assessment for Optus Senior Front End Developer Position

The implemntation uses
# Next.js + Jest

The reason I chose to use this metaframework as Next.js comes with built in linting and is a metaframework for implmenting SSR. To check linting and types run :

yarn build

## Run Jest Tests

- yarn test

 Will run the tests in watch mode. I wrote all tests at the beginning of the development of the app. I tested that front end UI components specifically the Bars would update and render as required based on the user inputs.

 ## Run Linting Type Checking and build

 - yarn build 

 Will run all linting and type checks, I used the default next.js linting setup !https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint
