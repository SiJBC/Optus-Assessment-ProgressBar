# Simon Colman submission for Progress bar Assessment for Optus Senior Front End Developer Position with
## Next.js + Jest

The metaframework Next.js comes has an up to date built in linting setup and the metaframework allows for implmenting SSR. 

### To check linting and types run :

yarn build

### To Run Jest Tests in watch mode

- yarn test

!http://localhost:3000



 Will run the tests in watch mode. I wrote all tests at the beginning of the development of the app. I tested that front end UI components specifically the Bars would update and render as required based on the user inputs.

 ## Run Linting Type Checking and build

 - yarn build 

 Will run all linting and type checks, I used the default next.js linting setup !https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint
